Made some changes to the JS game based on user feedback: 
- removed intro screen and hade intro text be at a frozen frame at the start of the game instead. 
- option to toggle music on and off and music is automatically off when the game loads
- you can toggle instructions on and off
- attack animation shows up when you press the attack key even if it doesn't hit the opponent

The changes went pretty fast to make thanks to ChatGPT.
