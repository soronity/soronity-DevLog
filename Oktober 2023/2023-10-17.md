I'm able to render the chessboard with pieces, right now as letters as placeholders for images. I've made it possible to see which square you can click on by turning it red. However, I can't make moves. There's some issue with CORS and it's tricky to debug. It's likely some issue with requests being sent from the frontend and the endpoints but I'm a bit too tired right now to figure out where the bug is.

All in all, I'm pleasantly surprised how quickly i'm grasping the lingo for frontend and backend and seeing how the program works on a big picture level!
