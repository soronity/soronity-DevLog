I've figured out a bunch of stuff today. First, I wasn't running the backend server yesterday while I was making requests from the frontend. Second, the frontend and backend have been speaking different languages basically. I've not used the correct notation that chess.js expects for moves and pieces. Plus, the board state is a right mess. ChatGPT didn't make the board representation correct, i.e. where the chess peices actually are in the frontend. It's mixed up rows and columns or something. Anyway, back at it after lunch.

ChatGPT has not been super helpful this afternoon. Seems that it's harder than I though to sync notation between chess.js and my frontend. I'll try again tomorrow.
