Got the chess game to work in so far as playing two players on the same computer! Dealt with a weird bug that was there because I didn't handle null squares well in board.js

Added a menu that you click on to show options. I'll add functionality to them as I go along, mos timportant is to reset and undo moves.

Not sure what next steps to take. Will have to ask Jeepie and take it from there.
