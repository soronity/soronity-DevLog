I've come upon the most frustrating problem so far in this project. When I opened up VS code to check on the app I get this error when running npm start: Invalid options object. Dev Server has been initialized using an options object that does not match the API schema.
 - options.allowedHosts[0] should be a non-empty string.

 I cannot for hte life of me figure out how to solve this. I've spent an hour of intense work trying various things. None of ChatGPT's advice works. StackOverflow is confusing. The worst part is the app was working fine yesterday when I made the latest commit! Even if I stash the latest work I've done and clear it so the project looks exactly like the latest commit, the problem persists. Whyyyyyyy tho. I know this is an important part of the process of learning but coooome ooon, this is just killing me. I hate these problems. 

...Ok so it works when I tried it at home... But not at campus, and I have no idea why -_-
