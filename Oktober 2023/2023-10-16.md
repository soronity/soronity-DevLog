Running into issues with trying to make moves using Postman. Getting the board state works but there's something about making moves that isn't working. I'm chugging along.

Oh, FINALLY got it to work! Apparently I had to set the header with a key "Content-type" and a value "application/json" for it to work even though in the body I used raw and JSON. It should have worked automatically but I guess not.

Seems like the backend is working somewhat now, at least the basic moves, check, checkmate, legal moves and reset.
