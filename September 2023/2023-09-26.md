Finally got the intro screen to work with the rest of the game. There was some issues with the logic of drawing the retart message. 

Tried to get some more animations going, like death and jump. At first the jump animation replaced idle and running so it looked like the players were jumping exclusively.

Next steps are to add SF, music and resize the canvas to an ideal size for the browser window
