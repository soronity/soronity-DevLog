Today I managed to resize the entire game; Canvas, collisions blocks, sprites and background image, which I had previously failed miserably at. I'm not sure why I struggled so much last time but maybe I've become more skilled in general at solving those kinds of problems. Seems that way. 

I tried to modularize the Player class into subclasses in a new branch but ended up getting stuck. Needless to say it was more challenging doing that than the other files. 

Anyway, I got some music going and that was an exhilirating experience! One of the coolest moments I've had. I got music specifically for the intro screen, the main game and the endgame screen. So cool. 

I also realized that there's an issue that's likely going to be hard to fix, namely that the animation speed is different for different screens, even on the same computer! My laptop screen shows a much faster animation speed than when I connect it to my monitor. Very strange but maybe tractable.

Tomorrow I'll get some SFX and try to fix the animation speed issue. Once they're done, I'll be satisfied with this project and move on to try to get my chess library working.
