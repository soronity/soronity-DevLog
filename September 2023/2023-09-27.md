Understood how JS files interact with each other by either being a module or not, and deciding to have the files be global or modules is important. For large projects, it's better to use the module approach as it can get really messy to debug if, for instance, two variables have the same name but are meant to have different types/values/etc. 

I managed to split up the code for the game code into several files, making it for more manageable now. Very happy about that and I'll definitely be utilizing that approach in the future for JS code. This should help with being able to resize the canvas.
