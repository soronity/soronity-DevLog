Made jump, death and attack animations! Removed double canvas because it didn't solve the flickering issue. Now I'm considering trying to add in React to the game and a backend with Express/Node.js and MongoDB to keep track of scores or something. Tomorrow I'll try to fix the inconsistent animation speed.
